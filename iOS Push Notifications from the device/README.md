## Sending APNS Push Notifications from an iOS app
This sample app uses the Realtime® Framework REST API to send customized push notifications through the APNS gateway. The Realtime application key used must have Push Notifications enabled with the appropriate APNS provisioning
 
> 
> **Don't forget to replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY` and `YOUR_APPLICATION_PRIVATE_KEY` with your own application key. If you don't already own a free Realtime® Framework application key, [get one now](https://accounts.realtime.co/signup/).**
